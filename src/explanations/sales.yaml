    We have achieved considerable success in our blockchain endeavors. Our
    educational solution has been highly acclaimed thus far, and with the
    introduction of new marketing features, we anticipate a significant increase
    in its value.



    The most effective method to connect with blockchain projects is through
    Discord. Upon joining a server, navigate to the announcements channel and
    identify the individuals who frequently post announcements. Initiate a
    direct message (DM) with these individuals, outlining our expertise and past
    project involvements. Additionally, numerous blockchain servers feature a
    partnership channel; if available, consider sending the message there too.

    We have recently begun to venture into selling our solution and offerings to
    Credit Unions. Our expectations for how it will unfold are uncertain at this
    point. The decision to target credit unions as potential customers is based
    on the shared values we have with them. Credit Unions prioritize people over
    profits.


    Credit Unions are known for their slower pace, and securing the initial sale
    can be an exhausting process that may span several months. However,
    acquiring just 2-3 details will set us on the path towards growth.
