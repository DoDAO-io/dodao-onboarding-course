      Smart contract auditing is the process of reviewing and testing the source
      code of a smart contract to identify any potential vulnerabilities or
      security issues. This can include checking for errors in the code,
      evaluating the contract's overall design and architecture, and testing the
      contract's functionality to ensure that it performs as intended. The goal
      of a smart contract audit is to ensure that the contract is secure and
      reliable, and that it will function as intended when deployed on a
      blockchain network.

    title: Sales
    details: >-
      Our primary goal is to create a product that sells itself, without
      requiring us to focus heavily on sales efforts. This process typically
      takes around 2-3 years to develop, and we consider it a journey in which
      we actively participate.


      During this initial stage, our focus is on listening and gathering as much
      information as possible. We don't need a large number of deals to achieve
      success; instead, we aim to work closely with a select group of valuable
      customers. Here are some important steps at this stage:


      1. Engage in meaningful conversations with customers and inquire about
      their current educational marketing strategies, methods for increasing
      awareness, and brand-building approaches.

      2. Understand what tools and solutions the customers are currently
      utilizing.

      3. Assess the level of automation in their processes.

      4. Validate the idea by confirming if the product we are selling is
      genuinely needed.

      5. Take note of the client's requirements and identify any gaps or missing
      features in our product.

      6. Finally, after completing the above steps, we can begin discussing our
      product with the customers.
